         <h1>Canada</h1>

 <p> A French and English country, founded in the 1860s. Founded 130 years ago, and still running as its own country. 
    
   
  The vikings were one of the first to inhabit Canada, but they only explored the tip of the iceberg. Indians still lived in Canada alone,
  and their homelands were undiscovered. So, 50 years later, the Europeans decided to explore Canada. 
  
   A new time for discovery. Jacques Cartier would sail his ship across the St. Lawrence River, and discover a new land, Canada, or, 
      as he called it, Kanata. 
       
      Soon, the French colonized Canada, and Canada gained independence. It is now what it is today.</p>
